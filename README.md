# fractal_renderer
A little tool that you can use to render [fractal curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_curve) iteration animations.

(But can't render the
[Mandelbrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set)- or
[Julia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set)
sets -- they're completely different. The only thing in common is infinite recursion.)

# Examples

## Koch snowflake
An example ([koch_snowflake.py](koch_snowflake.py)) that renders the popular [Koch snowflake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake) fractal.
